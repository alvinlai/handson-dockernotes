# Docker Notes sample app

This is an example of a Rails app that runs in a 
Docker container and is linked to a PostgreSQL 
database running in another container.

Both apps are used in the [Hands on with Docker](http://www.handsonwith.com/)
training class.

The PostgreSQL database's Dockerfile is
at https://github.com/alvinlai/handson-postgres.
